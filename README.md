# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm b42-sneak; nice to meet you!

This is my second GitHub account where I publish my open-source NSFW software which wouldn't look too good on a resume.
But SFW or not, I believe that all software should be Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), which is why I licence all my stuff under the [AGPL 3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html)

Happy coding!
