# My SVG logo

A logo/profile picture for b42-sneak

## Goals

- Create a uniform visual identity for my alt account (b42-sneak) across online platforms
- Express myself with a simple word/character mark
- Chose a different design approach compared to my main account
- Retain copyright (this is a logo for myself, it's exclusively bound to my identity on purpose)

## Strategy

- Pick a color using [The material design color palette](https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#tools-for-picking-colors)
  - Got `#73E610`
- Arrange my username (`b42-sneak`) in a three by three grid
- Put a background color behind it
- Add a second background color for contrast
